Step 1: Prepare Your Laravel and Vue Application
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you’ve installed all dependencies locally using composer install for Laravel and npm install for Vue.
Environment File:

Configure your .env file for production, including the database credentials and other environment variables.
Build Frontend:

Run npm run build to generate the production-ready Vue assets. These will be stored in the public folder of your Laravel app.
Test Locally:

Ensure the application runs correctly on your local machine before deployment.
Step 2: Prepare AWS
You’ll need to set up the following AWS resources:

S3 Bucket:

Use AWS S3 to store assets like images and backups.
Create a bucket, enable public access (if required), and configure it for hosting static assets.
RDS:

Set up an RDS instance for your database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).
Make note of the endpoint, username, and password.
Elastic Beanstalk (Optional):

Elastic Beanstalk can automate deployments and handle scaling for your Laravel app.
EC2:

Set up an EC2 instance if you prefer managing your own server for Laravel. Use Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu.
Step 3: Deploy Laravel
Install Laravel on EC2:

Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH.
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install php php-cli php-mbstring unzip curl git -y
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
Upload Code:

Use SCP, SFTP, or a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to upload your Laravel project to the EC2 instance.
Set Permissions:

Run the following to set the correct permissions:
bash
Copy code
sudo chown -R apache:apache /path/to/laravel
sudo chmod -R 775 /path/to/laravel/storage /path/to/laravel/bootstrap/cache
Configure Environment:

Update the .env file on the server to connect to your AWS RDS instance.
Set Up a Web Server:

Install and configure Apache or Nginx to serve the Laravel application.
Example for Apache:
bash
Copy code
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl start httpd
Run Laravel Commands:

Run migrations and seeders:
bash
Copy code
php artisan migrate --seed
Step 4: Deploy Vue
Host Vue Files:

Use S3 to host your Vue application. Upload the dist folder (output of npm run build) to the S3 bucket.
Enable website hosting in the S3 bucket settings.
Serve Frontend and Backend:

Use Laravel to serve both the API (backend) and Vue (frontend) or deploy them separately.
Update your .env file with the correct frontend URL if the backend needs to communicate with the Vue app.
Step 5: Automate with Terraform
Define Infrastructure:

Your main.tf file should describe the resources needed for the Laravel and Vue app.
Run Terraform Commands:

Initialize Terraform:
bash
Copy code
terraform init
Plan and apply:
bash
Copy code
terraform plan
terraform apply
Verify:

Check that all resources are created and accessible.
Step 6: Automate Deployment with CI/CD
Set Up Jenkins or GitHub Actions:

Use Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or another CI/CD tool to automate deployments.
Configure the pipeline to:
Pull code from your repository.
Build Vue assets.
Deploy Laravel to EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk.
Test:

Ensure the pipeline runs successfully and the app deploys automatically.
Step 7: Monitoring and Scaling
Set Up CloudWatch:

Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor logs and application performance.
Enable Auto Scaling:

Configure EC2 Auto Scaling or Elastic Beanstalk auto-scaling for better availability.
Backups:

Automate database backups using RDS snapshots.
